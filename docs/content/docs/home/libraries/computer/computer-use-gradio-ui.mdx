title: Gradio UI with the Python Computer Interface
description: The computer module includes a Gradio UI for creating and sharing demonstration data. This guide makes it easy for people to build community datasets for better computer use models with an upload to Huggingface feature.

<Callout title="Note">
  For precise control of the computer, we recommend using VNC or Screen Sharing
  instead of Gradio UI.

```bash
# Install with UI support
pip install "cua/computer[ui]"
```

## Building and Sharing Demonstrations with Huggingface

Follow these steps to contribute your own demonstrations:

### 1. Set up Huggingface Access

Set your HF_TOKEN in a .env file or in your environment variables:

```bash
# In .env file
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
```

### 2. Launch the Computer UI

```python
# launch_ui.py
from computer.ui.gradio.app import create_gradio_ui
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv('.env')

app = create_gradio_ui()
app.launch(share=False)
```

For examples, see [Computer UI Examples](https://github.com/trycua/cua/tree/main/examples/computer_ui_examples.py)

### 3. Record Your Tasks

</details>

Record yourself performing various computer tasks using the UI.

### 4. Save Your Demonstrations

    controls
    width="600"></video>
</details>

Save each task by picking a descriptive name and adding relevant tags (e.g., "office", "web-browsing", "coding").

### 5. Record Additional Demonstrations

Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have a good amount of demonstrations covering different tasks and scenarios.

### 6. Upload to Huggingface

</details>

Upload your dataset to Huggingface by:

- Naming it as `{your_username}/{dataset_name}`
- Choosing public or private visibility
- Optionally selecting specific tags to upload only tasks with certain tags
