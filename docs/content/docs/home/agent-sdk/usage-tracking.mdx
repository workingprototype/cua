description: How to track token usage and cost in ComputerAgent and agent loops.

Tracking usage is important for monitoring costs and optimizing your agent workflows. The ComputerAgent API provides easy access to token and cost usage for every run.

## Accessing Usage Data

Whenever you run an agent loop, each result contains a `usage` dictionary with token and cost information:

```python
async for result in agent.run(...):
    print(result["usage"])
    # Example output:
    # {
    #     "prompt_tokens": 150,
    #     "completion_tokens": 75,
    #     "total_tokens": 225,
    #     "response_cost": 0.01,
    # }
```

- `prompt_tokens`: Number of tokens in the prompt
- `completion_tokens`: Number of tokens in the agent's response
- `total_tokens`: Total tokens used
- `response_cost`: Estimated cost (USD) for this turn

## Tracking Total Usage

You can accumulate usage across multiple turns:

```python
total_usage = {"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 0, "response_cost": 0.0}
async for result in agent.run(...):
    for k in total_usage:
        total_usage[k] += result["usage"].get(k, 0)
print("Total usage:", total_usage)
```

## Using Callbacks for Usage Tracking

You can also use a callback to automatically track usage. Implement the `on_usage` method in your callback class:

```python
from agent.callbacks import AsyncCallbackHandler

class UsageTrackerCallback(AsyncCallbackHandler):
    async def on_usage(self, usage):
        print("Usage update:", usage)

agent = ComputerAgent(
    ..., 
    callbacks=[UsageTrackerCallback()]
)
```
