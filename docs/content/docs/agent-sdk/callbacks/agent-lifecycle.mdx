# Callbacks

Callbacks provide hooks into the agent lifecycle for extensibility. They're called in a specific order during agent execution.

## Callback Lifecycle

### 1. `on_run_start(kwargs, old_items)`
Called once when agent run begins. Initialize tracking, logging, or state.

### 2. `on_run_continue(kwargs, old_items, new_items)` → bool
Called before each iteration. Return `False` to stop execution (e.g., budget limits).

### 3. `on_llm_start(messages)` → messages
Preprocess messages before LLM call. Use for PII anonymization, image retention.

### 4. `on_api_start(kwargs)`
Called before each LLM API call.

### 5. `on_api_end(kwargs, result)`
Called after each LLM API call completes.

### 6. `on_usage(usage)`
Called when usage information is received from LLM.

### 7. `on_llm_end(messages)` → messages
Postprocess messages after LLM call. Use for PII deanonymization.

### 8. `on_responses(kwargs, responses)`
Called when responses are received from agent loop.

### 9. Response-specific hooks:
- `on_text(item)` - Text messages
- `on_computer_call_start(item)` - Before computer actions
- `on_computer_call_end(item, result)` - After computer actions
- `on_function_call_start(item)` - Before function calls
- `on_function_call_end(item, result)` - After function calls
- `on_screenshot(screenshot, name)` - When screenshots are taken

### 10. `on_run_end(kwargs, old_items, new_items)`
Called when agent run completes. Finalize tracking, save trajectories.

## Built-in Callbacks

- **ImageRetentionCallback**: Limits recent images in context
- **BudgetManagerCallback**: Stops execution when budget exceeded
- **TrajectorySaverCallback**: Saves conversation trajectories
- **LoggingCallback**: Logs agent activities
