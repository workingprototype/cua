title: Computer-Use Models
description: Models that support full computer-use agent capabilities with ComputerAgent.run()
---

These models support complete computer-use agent functionality through `ComputerAgent.run()`. They can understand natural language instructions and autonomously perform sequences of actions to complete tasks.

All agent loops are compatible with any LLM provider supported by LiteLLM.

See [Running Models Locally](../local-models) for how to use Hugging Face and MLX models on your own machine.

## Anthropic CUAs

Claude models with computer-use capabilities:

- Claude 4: `claude-opus-4-20250514`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- Claude 3.7: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- Claude 3.5: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`

```python
agent = ComputerAgent("claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", tools=[computer])
async for _ in agent.run("Open Firefox and navigate to github.com"):
    pass
```

## OpenAI CUA Preview

OpenAI's computer-use preview model:

- Computer-use-preview: `computer-use-preview`

```python
agent = ComputerAgent("openai/computer-use-preview", tools=[computer])
async for _ in agent.run("Take a screenshot and describe what you see"):
    pass
```

## UI-TARS 1.5

Unified vision-language model for computer-use:

- `huggingface-local/ByteDance-Seed/UI-TARS-1.5-7B`
- `huggingface/ByteDance-Seed/UI-TARS-1.5-7B` (requires TGI endpoint)

```python
agent = ComputerAgent("huggingface-local/ByteDance-Seed/UI-TARS-1.5-7B", tools=[computer])
async for _ in agent.run("Open the settings menu and change the theme to dark mode"):
    pass
```
