title: Composed Agents
description: Combine grounding models with any LLM for computer-use capabilities
---

Composed agents combine the best of both worlds: specialized grounding models for precise click prediction and powerful LLMs for task planning and reasoning.

Use the format `"grounding_model+thinking_model"` to create a composed agent with any vision-enabled LiteLLM-compatible model.

## How Composed Agents Work

1. **Planning Phase**: The thinking model (LLM) analyzes the task and decides what actions to take (e.g., `click("find the login button")`, `type("username")`)
2. **Grounding Phase**: The grounding model converts element descriptions to precise coordinates
3. **Execution**: Actions are performed using the predicted coordinates

## Supported Grounding Models

Any model that supports `predict_click()` can be used as the grounding component:

- `omniparser` (OSS set-of-marks model)
- `huggingface-local/HelloKKMe/GTA1-7B` (OSS grounding model)
- `huggingface-local/ByteDance-Seed/UI-TARS-1.5-7B` (OSS unified model)
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (Anthropic CUA)
- `openai/computer-use-preview` (OpenAI CUA)

## Supported Thinking Models

Any vision-enabled LiteLLM-compatible model can be used as the thinking component:

- **Anthropic**: `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229`
- **OpenAI**: `openai/gpt-5`, `openai/gpt-o3`, `openai/gpt-4o`
- **Google**: `gemini/gemini-1.5-pro`, `vertex_ai/gemini-pro-vision`
- **Local models**: Any Hugging Face vision-language model

## Usage Examples

### GTA1 + GPT-5

Use Google's Gemini for planning with specialized grounding:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(
    "huggingface-local/HelloKKMe/GTA1-7B+openai/gpt-5",
    tools=[computer]
)

async for _ in agent.run("Take a screenshot, analyze the UI, and click on the most prominent button"):
    pass
```

### GTA1 + Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Combine state-of-the-art grounding with powerful reasoning:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(
    "huggingface-local/HelloKKMe/GTA1-7B+anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", 
    tools=[computer]
)

async for _ in agent.run("Open Firefox, navigate to github.com, and search for 'computer-use'"):
    pass
# Success! 🎉
# - Claude 3.5 Sonnet plans the sequence of actions
# - GTA1-7B provides precise click coordinates for each UI element
```

### UI-TARS + GPT-4o

Combine two different vision models for enhanced capabilities:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(
    "huggingface-local/ByteDance-Seed/UI-TARS-1.5-7B+openai/gpt-4o",
    tools=[computer]
)

async for _ in agent.run("Help me fill out this form with my personal information"):
    pass
```

## Benefits of Composed Agents

- **Specialized Grounding**: Use models optimized for click prediction accuracy
- **Flexible Planning**: Choose any LLM for task reasoning and planning
- **Cost Optimization**: Use smaller grounding models with larger planning models only when needed
- **Performance**: Leverage the strengths of different model architectures

## Capabilities

Composed agents support both capabilities:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent("huggingface-local/HelloKKMe/GTA1-7B+anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")

# Full computer-use agent capabilities
async for _ in agent.run("Complete this online form"):
    pass

# Direct click prediction (uses grounding model only)
coords = agent.predict_click("find the submit button")
```
