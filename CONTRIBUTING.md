## Reporting Bugs

If you've encountered a bug in the project, we encourage you to report it. Please follow these steps:

1. **Check the Issue Tracker**: Before submitting a new bug report, please check our issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported.
2. **Create a New Issue**: If the bug hasn't been reported, create a new issue with:

   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (macOS version, lume version)
   - Any relevant logs or error messages
3. **Label Your Issue**: Label your issue as a `bug` to help maintainers identify it quickly.

## Suggesting Enhancements

We're always looking for suggestions to make lume better. If you have an idea:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: See if someone else has already suggested something similar.
2. **Create a New Issue**: If your enhancement is new, create an issue describing:
   - The problem your enhancement solves
