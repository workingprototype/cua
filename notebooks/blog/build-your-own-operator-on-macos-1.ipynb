    "We'll learn how to combine the OpenAI Responses API (using the `computer-use-preview` model) with the CUA macOS interface to automate tasks. Instead of using Playwright like in the original [OpenAI CUA docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use), we use the CUA computer to control a macOS sandbox (via the Lume CLI) and execute actions such as clicking and typing. The loop is as follows:\n",
